## Repository Navigation: 
See the directories above for the main topics which currently include:
- **Large-Scale Structure:** For LSS related science papers across all surveys
- **Coding:** A general stop of coding resources including tutories, read-the-docs, install instructions, UW-Madison/DES/LSST computing, and more

_Note: the topical catagories above may be degenerate with the general survey catagories, try to put links in both if something is applicable to more than one catagory. For example a deeplenstronomy resources might be linked in both coding and lensing._

#### Clicking into one of these directories will take you to a page similar to this one that will have more information about the topic and what is included. Inside each repository listed above will be sub-directories that either house the documents themselves if a url link doesn't exist/isn't accessible, or they will list a subtopic that follows this same structure.
